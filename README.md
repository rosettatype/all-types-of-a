# All types of “a”

A collection of peculiar forms of the Latin lowercase letter “a” (U+0061) subjectively selected in order to make a point that an essential form of an “a”, if it exists, must be really rather complex.

## Contributing

1. Clone this repo.
2. Add an image with the letter “a”:
    - scale the letter proportionally to the other letters on the website,
    - convert the letter to outlines,
    - use transparent background,
    - use black (`#000000`) for the letter fill,
    - save as an SVG to `assets/letters/`.
3. Add info to `_data/data.yaml`, set `path:` to the SVG file.
4. Commit and initiate a pull request.

## Criteria

1. The “a” can be from a digital font.
2. It can be a digitization of a non-digital lettering or typeface.
3. Include only letters that are *quite different* from what is already included. Helvetica and Neue Haas Grotesque are not quite different in this sense. Neither is Times and Baskerville.
4. It has to be an “a”, obviously. Encoded and recognizable as such. Do not include uppercase forms, even if encoded as lowercase.
